# Security Compliance: An Overview

Security compliance refers to the process of ensuring that an organizationâ€™s systems, processes, and operations meet established security standards, regulations, and laws.

## Relationship Between Security Compliance and Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. Security compliance, on the other hand, focuses on adhering to policies, laws, and standards that ensure cybersecurity measures are adequate and effective.

In essence:

- **Cybersecurity** is about *doing* security.  
- **Compliance** is about *proving* that you are doing security according to recognized guidelines.  

A strong cybersecurity posture naturally supports compliance efforts, while compliance requirements often drive the adoption of cybersecurity best practices.
